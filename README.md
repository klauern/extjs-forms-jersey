This is a very simple project to demonstrate simple concepts in [ExtJS][1] and [Jersey][2].

As in a similar vein to my [other project][3], I wanted to see what Jersey did to handle form params,
so this is the same project, only using Jersey and the default Maven Archetype template that
the Jersey guys so graciously provided (kudos).
